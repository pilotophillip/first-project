# My Portfolio Website - Phillip Piloto

This is my first portfolio website, built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I originally developed it in Sublime Text before migrating it to VS Code and uploading it to GitHub.

This project was created before I enrolled in any formal software engineering bootcamp and stands as a testament to my self-learning ability and dedication to becoming a front-end developer. It showcases my skills, highlights personal projects, and provides a way for users to get in touch with me.

Several features were implemented using JavaScript to enhance interactivity and user experience. This project represents an important milestone in my journey as a self-taught developer and laid the foundation for my continued growth through formal training and real-world experience.

## Features

- **Responsive Design:** The website adapts to different screen sizes, ensuring an optimal experience across desktop and mobile devices.
